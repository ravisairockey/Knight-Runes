## 1. Introduction & Vision

**Knight-Runes** is an immersive web-based experience designed to serve as a living concept for a mythical action-adventure game. It showcases the world, narrative, and core aesthetic of the project through a single, beautifully designed webpage. Our vision is to create a sense of wonder and mystery, inviting users to step into the shattered dimension of Templum Arcamenis.
